\title{concstats:  Market Structure, Concentration, and Inequality Measures}
\description{
Based on individual market shares of all participants in a
market or space, the package offers a set of different structural
and concentration measures frequently - and not so frequently - used
in research and in practice. Measures can be calculated in groups or
individually.
The calculated measure or the resulting vector of measures in table
format should help practitioners make more informed decisions.
To learn more about how to use concstats, see the vignettes at
\url{https://docs.ropensci.org/concstats/} or using the following
code in your console:

\code{browseVignettes(package = "concstats")}

This package provides a set of functions for calculating measures to
get insights of a given market. Measures are, e.g. the
Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI) or its dual, Entropy, Gini or
Palmer measure, as well as the Top market performer (by shares).
Monitoring markets is particularly useful for government agencies,
but also used in research or even on firm level.
While all functions rely on individual shares provided by the user,
the user might use a helper function to convert variables to shares.
